# ROCK_MINE_PREDICTION


# Rock vs Mine Prediction 🎯

This project uses machine learning models to classify sonar signals as either rocks or mines based on frequency features.

## 🔍 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository (Sonar Dataset)
- **Format:** CSV
- **Features:** 60 numerical values representing sonar signal energy in various frequency bands
- **Label:** `R` for Rock, `M` for Mine

## 🚀 Models Used
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix (with heatmap)
- Classification report (precision, recall, f1-score)

## 📁 Files
- `rock_vs_mine.ipynb` – Main notebook with all code and visualizations
- `Sonar data.csv` – Dataset used
- `sonar_dataset.zip` – Zipped version of the dataset

## 🧠 Key Highlights
- Achieved high accuracy using SVC and KNN
- Visualized performance using confusion matrix heatmaps
- Clean and simple implementation, ideal for beginners
